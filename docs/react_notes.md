# React Notes

## Concepts

#### Creating An App:
To create your first react app: 
    - download `node.js` from the nodejs.org website
    - use the command `npx create-react-app (app name)` or create a folder in a directory on your computer and drag it into your VScode     editor, then use the command `npx create-react-app` with the current directory

To start your app, use the command: `npm start`. You can have this open while editing app to see real-time updates.

#### File/Folder Structure

Main
    - `/node_modules/`:
